jugglingdb-mssql
================

MsSQL adapter for the jugglingdb ORM. Compatible with Azure SQL Server.

Now passing all tests exposed by the jugglingdb framework!

Usage
---
To use it you need <pre><code>jugglingdb@0.2.x</code></pre> and mssql

1. Setup dependencies in package.json:
  <pre>
    <code>
    {
      ...
      "dependencies":{
        "mssql":"~0.5.3",
        "jugglingdb": "~0.2.0",
        "jugglingdb-mssql":"latest"
      }
      ...
    }
    </code>
  </pre>
2. Use:
  <pre>
    <code>
    var Schema = require("jugglingdb").Schema;
    var schema = new Schema("mssql", {host:"YourSqlServer", database:"YourDatabase"});
    ...
    </code>
  </pre>
  <pre>
    <code>
    var Schema = require("jugglingdb").Schema;
    var schema = new Schema("mssql", {host:"AzureServer", database:"YourDatabase",
                                      username: "YourUserName", password: "YourPassword",
                                      azure: true});
    ...
    </code>
  </pre>
3. Primary Keys:
  using anything other than the default 'id' as the primary key
  will cause the hasMany and belongsTo relationships in jugglingdb to
  not work, and possibly other oddities as well (so you probably
  shouldn't use it until it's officially supported).

  to specify a custom primary key name for a model use
  <pre>
    <code>
      var AppliesTo = schema.define("AppliesTo", {
        AppliesToID: {
          type:Number,
          primaryKey:true
        },
        Title: {
          type:String,
          limit:100
        },
        Identifier: {
          type:String,
          limit:100
        },
        Editable: {
          type:Number
        }
      });
    </code>
  </pre>
